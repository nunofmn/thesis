With an increased usage of Distributed Hash Tables (DHT) as a basis for building scalable Peer-to-Peer (P2P) systems, the security considerations and close participation in DHTs systems are still major concerns.

One system that is built using a DHT system is the Global Registry component of the European funded research project reTHINK.
With the necessity of securing the DHT system of this component, by at the same time reducing trust between participants in the DHT, we present IDChain.
The IDChain system is a Decentralized Public Key Infrastructure (DPKI) built on top of the Ethereum blockchain, which allows Service Providers (SP) to associate nodes with an identity, providing therefore access control and secure communications between nodes, in a decentralized fashion.
Our approach comprises the creation of a smart contract in the Ethereum blockchain which mimics a Web of Trust model, allowing entities (SP) to register their unique nodes' identifiers and certificates, therefore enabling connection establishement between nodes through TLS.
In order to ease the integration and management of the system, we also built a RESTful API and a management web application.

This document surveys the current state of the art of P2P systems and DHTs security mechanisms. Our proposal, which consists of the IDChain system and a Certificate Authority (CA) based system (for comparison proposes), is presented in detail and validated through performance, security and monetary cost evaluation.
We show that the IDChain proof-of-concept is performant and secure, therefore presenting a valid alternative to a CA-based solution.
