Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending. We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network. The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.},

    abstract = {An encryption method is presented with the novel property that publicly revealing an encryption key does not thereby reveal the corresponding decryption key. This has two important consequences: (1) Couriers or other secure means are not needed to transmit keys, since a message can be enciphered using an encryption key publicly revealed by the intented recipient. Only he can decipher the message, since only he knows the corresponding decryption key. (2) A message can be “signed” using a privately held decryption key. Anyone can verify this signature using the corresponding publicly revealed encryption key. Signatures cannot be forged, and a signer cannot later deny the validity of his signature. This has obvious applications in “electronic mail” and “electronic funds transfer” systems. A message is encrypted by representing it as a number M, raising M to a publicly specified power e, and then taking the remainder when the result is divided by the publicly specified product, n, of two large secret primer numbers p and q. Decryption is similar; only a different, secret, power d is used, where e * d ≡ 1(mod (p - 1) * (q - 1)). The security of the system rests in part on the difficulty of factoring the published divisor, n.},

    abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 20 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

While elegant from a theoretical perspective, those systems face difficulties under an open environment. Not only frequently joining and leaving of nodes generate enormous maintenance overhead, but also various behaviors and resources of peers compromise overlay performance and security. Instead of building P2P overlay from the theoretical view, this paper builds the overlay network from the perspective of the physical network. By combining different network topology-aware techniques, a distinctive overlay network that closely matches the Internet topology is constructed. The P2P system based on this structure is not only highly efficient for routing, but also keeps maintenance overhead very low even under highly dynamic environment. Moreover, the system provides a new aspect to solve many security issues},

This paper presents SybilGuard, a novel protocol for limiting the corruptive influences of sybil attacks. Our protocol is based on the ldquosocial networkrdquo among user identities, where an edge between two identities indicates a human-established trust relationship. Malicious users can create many identities but few trust relationships. Thus, there is a disproportionately small ldquocutrdquo in the graph between the sybil nodes and the honest nodes. SybilGuard exploits this property to bound the number of identities a malicious user can create. We show the effectiveness of SybilGuard both analytically and experimentally.},

@article{Yu2010,
    abstract = {Open-access distributed systems such as peer-to-peer systems are particularly vulnerable to <i>sybil attacks</i>, where a malicious user creates multiple fake identities (called <i>sybil nodes</i>). Without a trusted central authority that can tie identities to real human beings, defending against sybil attacks is quite challenging. Among the small number of decentralized approaches, our recent SybilGuard protocol leverages a key insight on social networks to bound the number of sybil nodes accepted. Despite its promising direction, SybilGuard can allow a large number of sybil nodes to be accepted. Furthermore, SybilGuard assumes that social networks are fast-mixing, which has never been confirmed in the real world. This paper presents the novel SybilLimit protocol that leverages the same insight as SybilGuard, but offers dramatically improved and near-optimal guarantees. The number of sybil nodes accepted is reduced by a factor of <i>{\&}amp;{\#}x0398;({\&}amp;{\#}x221A;n</i>), or around 200 times in our experiments for a million-node system. We further prove that SybilLimit's guarantee is at most a <i>logn</i> factor away from optimal when considering approaches based on fast-mixing social networks. Finally, based on three large-scale real-world social networks, we provide the first evidence that real-world social networks are indeed fast-mixing. This validates the fundamental assumption behind SybilLimit's and SybilGuard's approach.},

@article{Singh2006,
    abstract = {Overlay networks are widely used to deploy functionality at edge nodes without changing network routers. Each node in an overlay network maintains connections with a number of peers, forming a graph upon which a distributed application or service is implemented. In an "Eclipse" attack, a set of malicious, colluding overlay nodes arranges for a correct node to peer only with members of the coalition. If successful, the attacker can mediate most or all communication to and from the victim. Furthermore, by supplying biased neighbor information during normal overlay maintenance, a modest number of malicious nodes can eclipse a large number of correct victim nodes. This paper studies the impact of Eclipse attacks on structured overlays and shows the limitations of known defenses. We then present the design, implementation, and evaluation of a new defense, in which nodes anonymously audit each other's connectivity. The key observation is that a node that mounts an Eclipse attack must have a higher than average node degree. We show that enforcing a node degree limit by auditing is an effective defense against Eclipse attacks. Furthermore, unlike most existing defenses, our defense leaves flexibility in the selection of neighboring nodes, thus permitting important overlay optimizations like proximity neighbor selection (PNS).},

    abstract = {Distributed hash tables (DHT) are a key building block for modern P2P content-distribution system, for example in implementing the distributed tracker of BitTorrent Mainline DHT. DHTs, due to their fully distributed nature, are known to be vulnerable to certain kinds of attacks and different kinds of defenses have been proposed against these attacks. In this paper, we consider two kinds of attacks on a DHT, one already known attack and one new kind of an attack, and show how they can be targeted against Mainline DHT. We complement them by an extensive measurement study using honeypots which shows that both attacks have been going on for a long time in the network and are still happening. We present numbers showing that the number of sybils in the Mainline DHT network is increasing and is currently around 300,000. We analyze the potential threats from these attacks and propose simple countermeasures against them. [ABSTRACT FROM PUBLISHER]},
