I would like to thank my advisor, Professor Ricardo Lopes Pereira, for his help and guidance during the elaboration of this dissertation.

To my family – specially my parents and my sister – for all the encouragement and advice through my academic journey.

Also to my friends and loved ones from Instituto Superior Técnico, and Setúbal, who have always been by my side in the fun times, but also in the hardest times.

A special thanks to Catarina Mansos, for all the patience and support in the last year.
